First of all, we’ll need to find a suitable 3D model. There are lots of free models available on the internet. However, Three.js recommended to use a model with glTF format due to small file size and efficiency. So I’m going to download the one that already in glTF format. But if you already have a model in other formats, three.js is also support FBX and obj file as well. In this tutorial we had used Lamborghini 3D Model.

We’ll use three.js OrbitControl plugin to add a 360 degree viewer that let the users rotate the camera. Get the OrbitControls.js from github and include it to the page.
