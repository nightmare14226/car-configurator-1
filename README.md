First of all, we’ll need to find a suitable 3D model. There are lots of free models available on the internet. However, Three.js recommended to use a model with glTF format due to small file size and efficiency. So I’m going to download the one that already in glTF format. But if you already have a model in other formats, three.js is also support FBX and obj file as well. In this tutorial we had used Lamborghini 3D Model.

We’ll use three.js OrbitControl plugin to add a 360 degrees viewer that let the users rotate the camera. Get the OrbitControls.js from github and include it to the page.
Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!
